/**
 * Player Character Controller
 * 
 * Manages the player character's attributes, movement, and interactions
 * within the game world. This class implements the Human interface
 * and provides core player functionality for the horror survival game.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Character movement and speed control
 * - Physical attributes (weight, gender)  
 * - Item interaction system
 * - Player state management
 * 
 * The Player class serves as the central point for all player-related
 * game mechanics and provides the interface between user input and
 * game world interactions.
