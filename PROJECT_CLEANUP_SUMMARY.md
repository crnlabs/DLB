# Project Cleanup Summary

## Interface Organization Completed

The DLB project has been successfully reorganized to better separate interfaces from implementations, improving code organization and maintainability.

## New Structure

### Before Cleanup
All interfaces and implementation classes were mixed together in the main `dontlookback` package, making it difficult to distinguish between contracts (interfaces) and implementations.

### After Cleanup

```
src/dontlookback/
â”œâ”€â”€ interfaces/              # ðŸ†• Dedicated interface package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Entities.java        # Core entity contract
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Intangibles.java     # Environmental objects
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Light.java           # Light source contract
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Biped.java           # Two-legged creatures
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Human.java           # Human-specific interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ NPC.java             # Non-player character contract
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Enemy.java           # Enemy behavior contract
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Monster.java         # Monster-specific interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Monsters.java        # Monster collection interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Quadraped.java       # Four-legged creatures
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Furnature.java       # Furniture objects
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Movable.java         # Movable object contract
â”œâ”€â”€ [Implementation Classes] # All concrete implementations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Player.java          # Implements Human interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BasicMonster.java    # Implements Monster interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Grue.java            # Extends BasicMonster
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LookBasedMonster.java # Extends BasicMonster
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Objects.java         # Implements Entities interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cube.java            # Extends Objects
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LightSource.java     # Implements Light interface
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [System Classes]     # Graphics, StateManager, etc.
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Clear Interface Separation**
- All 12 game interfaces are now in a dedicated `dontlookback.interfaces` package
- Easy to identify contracts vs implementations
- Improved code navigation and understanding

### 2. **Better Organization**
- Interfaces define clear contracts for game behavior
- Implementation classes properly import from interfaces package
- Logical grouping of related functionality

### 3. **Maintained Compatibility**
- All 39 tests continue to pass
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Clean compilation with proper import statements

### 4. **Enhanced Maintainability**
- Easier to modify interfaces without affecting implementations
- Clear dependency hierarchy
- Better support for future refactoring

## Interface Hierarchy

```
Entities (base interface)
â”œâ”€â”€ Furnature extends Entities

Intangibles (base interface)  
â”œâ”€â”€ Light extends Intangibles

NPC (base interface)
â”œâ”€â”€ Enemy extends NPC
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Monster extends Enemy
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Monsters extends Enemy
â””â”€â”€ Quadraped extends NPC

Biped (base interface)
â””â”€â”€ Human extends Biped

Movable (standalone interface)
```

## Implementation Examples

### Before
```java
// Mixed in main package
public interface Human extends Biped { ... }
public class Player implements Human { ... }
```

### After
```java
// Clear separation
// In dontlookback.interfaces:
public interface Human extends Biped { ... }

// In main dontlookback package:
import dontlookback.interfaces.Human;
public class Player implements Human { ... }
```

## Validation Results

- âœ… **Build Status**: Clean compilation
- âœ… **Test Status**: All 39 tests passing
- âœ… **Interface Separation**: Complete
- âœ… **Import Structure**: Properly organized
- âœ… **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained

The project cleanup successfully addresses the requirement to "better separate and organize the codebase" with a focus on interface separation, providing a cleaner, more maintainable code structure while preserving all existing functionality.
